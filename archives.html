<h3>Words of Wisdom: Achieving Successful Jobs for Individual’s with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (March 23, 2016)</h3>
<p>More and more individuals with autism have been able to go to work in the community. Quality employment practices have been studied, shared, and documented.

<h3>Volunteering, Internships, and Unpaid Work Experiences: Legal and Practical Guidelines (February 25, 2016)</h3>

<p>With the expansion of employment in the community and community based non-work, volunteering, internships, and similar activities for people with disabilities are becoming increasingly a part of their daily routines.

<p>This webinar will look at both legal and practical guidelines for these types of experiences, with a focus on complying with the legal requirements that apply under these circumstances, as well as how such experiences fit within overall efforts to expand employment and community opportunities.

<h3>Building Friendships At Work (January 27, 2016)</h3>
<p>It is abundantly clear that friendships are important in everyone's lives. People with friends are happier than those who don't have friends. They have greater self-esteem. They are healthier and they are safer. These benefits can be especially critical for people with disabilities in a world that still often isolates them.</p>

<p>Widening the Circle is a partnership between the Arc of MA and the MA Department of Developmental Services. This project has been exploring the opportunities—formal and informal—that support the development of friendships between people with and without disabilities. These opportunities for friendships are everywhere, where people live, learn, play and WORK.</p>

<p>Please join Rick Hawes (Director of Employment Services at the Berkshire County Arc) and Jim Ross (Co-coordinator of Widening the Circle) as they explore WHY supporting friendships in the workplace is important. This webinar will also discuss WHAT employment staff can do to support friendships. Whether you facilitate planning, are a job developer, or are a job coach, there is a role for you!</p>
