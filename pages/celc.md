<h2>Everyone is talking about Customized Employment, but do you really understand what it is and how to put it into practice?</h2>

<p>Simply put, Customized Employment means individualizing the employment relationship between employees and employers while meeting the needs of both. Putting it into practice effectively requires new knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The Institute for Community Inclusion, with support from the Department of Developmental Services and in partnership with Massachusetts-based subject matter experts is launching a 12-month Customized Employment Learning Community. The learning community model provides training on Customized Employment and ongoing support to help participants put what they learn into practice. It also provides the opportunity to learn from experienced practitioners and peers.</p>

<h3>The learning community will include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Four full day in-person training sessions</li>
<li>Monthly one-hour virtual meetings</li>
<li>Access to tools and resources</li>
<li>Support from peers and subject matter experts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applicants must meet the following qualifications:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A minimum of two years of experience working with individuals with disabilities</li>
<li>A minimum of one year of experience providing employment supports</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additionally, applicants must:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit a letter of recommendation and commitment from their supervisor, manager or other leader in their agency to be uploaded as part of the online application</li>
<li>Commit to identifying two learning partners â€“ individuals they can work with to put into practice what they are learning.</li>
<li>Commit to participating in the full 12-month Learning Community</li>
</ul>
<p>The Customized Employment Learning Community will kick-off with a full day event on <strong>Thursday, December 5, 2019</strong>. Candidates selected for the learning community are required to attend this session. Their supervisor/manager is also expected to attend this first session. Applicants and their supervisor/ manager should save this date to ensure their availability should they be selected. Applicants will be notified of their acceptance by November 22, 2019.</p>
