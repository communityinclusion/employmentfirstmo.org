---
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-9">

<p>As Massachusetts service providers expand their efforts to increase employment of individuals with intellectual and development disabilities, expanding capacity to place individuals with major challenges is critical. This day-long seminar will focus on strategies for assisting individuals with the most significant disabilities to find employment. During the first half of this seminar, Dr. Domenico Cavaiuolo will share stories of numerous individuals who have become successfully employed, despite a perception by many that they were “unemployable” due to their level of disability or behavior challenges. The core principles of successful job placements for these individuals will be discussed. During the second half of the day, attendees will share profiles of individuals they are working with, and the group will develop specific strategies for assisting these individuals to become successfully employed.</p>

<p>About the Presenter: Dr. Domenico Cavaiuolo is currently a Professor of Special Education and Rehabilitative/Human Services at East Stroudsburg University. He has been involved in the field of rehabilitation and special education for over 37 years at various levels.  Prior to the position he currently holds at the University, Dr. Cavaiuolo was as the Vice President of Support Services of Via of the Lehigh Valley Inc., and prior to that he was the Executive Director of Pioneer Agency Inc., a highly respected and innovative agency that converted its sheltered workshop into a total supported employment agency in Syracuse, New York.  In both of these major positions, Dr. Cavaiuolo was involved in a program/systems change using consumer driven/person centered planning as a method for service delivery. Dr. Cavaiuolo has published books, chapters in books and authored/co-authored articles on supported employment.  He has also conducted training seminars on conversion of sheltered workshops to community integrated employment options, natural supports in the work place, behavioral supports in the work place, cooperative learning as an inclusionary method in schools, and transition from school to adult life.  Most pertinent, has been his consultation with various agencies and school districts on conversion, natural supports, community based options, inclusive practices and transition concepts.
