title: A New Day - Creating Pathways to Employment and Meaningful Days
---


<div class="row">
	<div class="col-lg-9">
 <p>This one-day training presented by Sara Murphy, Program Director at Transcen will introduce participants to the WorkLink model.   A wrap around approach to employment and day supports, this model has led to employment outcomes and meaningful days for individuals with significant barriers to employment.  This flexible, hybrid approach allows support plans to be "built to order".  Employment is the program's primary goal.  Day services are focused on the discovery process, exploring vocational options and building employment skills. Participants also use day services for non-work needs and to augment part-time work schedules.  Sara will discuss the braided approach to services and management of a 100% community based, individualized program that is currently being replicated in a number of locations in California. </p>
 <p>This training is designed for executive directors, program managers and others who have responsibility for program development.  Attendees are encouraged to bring their own devices (laptop, tablet and/or smart phone) for use during this training. </p>
