Employment First Missouri is a collaborative initiative between the <a href="https://dmh.mo.gov/dev-disabilities">Missouri Division of Developmental Disabilities (DD)</a> and the <a href="https://www.communityinclusion.org/">Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) </a>at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Under this initiative, ICI provides technical assistance (consultation services), training, and access to a wide range of tools and resources to service providers and staff to advance community employment for individuals in the state of Missouri who have intellectual and developmental disabilities. 

Since the Employment First Missouri initiative was formed in 2018, a wide variety of agencies across Missouri have received technical assistance to develop expanded capacity to provide integrated employment supports. Technical assistance is provided by ICI staff who live and work in Missouri, under the direction of David Hoff, who has provided technical assistance across the United States and internationally, and with the full support of ICI. 
If you are a provider who contracts with Missouri Department of Mental Health, Division of Developmental Disabilities to provide employment services, and are interested in receiving technical assistance, please fill out this <a href="https://umassboston.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0r2NIq9NNxoEuep">inquiry form</a> and a team member will contact you to discuss your needs.
