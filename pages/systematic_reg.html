<div class="row">
	<div class="col-lg-9">
 <p>Introduced into our field over 35 years ago, systematic instruction continues to be an important tool in expanding employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. It is essential in supporting those who experience greater challenges and who may not be considered "job ready". In addition the task analysis and individualizing teaching strategies allow for consideration of jobs or tasks that may have been perceived as too complex for job seekers with intellectual disabilities. </p>

<p>Presented by Teri Johnson, this two-day training will cover the components of systematic instruction including the concept of Universal Design in developing workplace supports. Participants will learn to use a task analysis to support effective training and to document progress, to address safety concerns and support independent job performance. The importance of accommodating learning styles through individualized teaching strategies will be stressed. Emphasis will be placed on strategies to maximize independence and decrease dependence on paid employment staff. </p>

<p>This session is designed for employment staff who have at least one year of experience providing employment supports and who are currently working with individuals in integrated employment settings.  Participants must attend both days. </p>
