<p><img src="/img/MPTE_logo.png" alt="MPTE" class="img-fluid float-left" style="max-width:250px; padding-right:2em;" > One of the 4 focus areas of MPTE is ensuring that youth and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have work experiences and paid employment in integrated settings similar to their peers without disabilities, and within these efforts, building capacity for access to postsecondary education and training that positively impacts employment outcomes.</p> 

<p>To accomplish this, MPTE is developing guidance and best practice indicators, so that a) individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are supported in typical individualized youth work experiences while in school, b) service providers that assist individuals to gain work experience are fully inclusive of young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and c) individuals have full access and necessary supports to succeed in postsecondary education that enhances their skills for in-demand professions.
