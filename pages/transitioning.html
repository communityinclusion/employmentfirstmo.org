---
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-9">

<p>Implementation of the MA Blueprint for Success will involve transitions for staff who have typically provided services in center-based environments. This introductory training provides center-based staff with an overview of the emerging service environment as it relates to the ongoing transformation to competitive work and community activity, and the implications for their work. </p>

<p>Participants will explore the values shift that is underway and learn about promising practices in community-based work and non-work services. We will also discuss ways to engage individuals, family members, and other stakeholders. The training will include structured group activities along with facilitated discussion.</p>
