<p> With small business ownership becoming the fastest growing segment for new employment options in the United States, the New England Business Development Center is supporting individuals to become successful business owners.  These individuals not only run and manage their business but are now key players in the economic development within their communities.

<p>When looking for a new job, most of us “do the math.”  We consider what we need (food, housing, healthcare) and what we want (a gym membership, a car, a vacation). Then we evaluate whether a particular job will help us achieve our goals.  So why do our conversations about employment for people with disabilities start with protecting Social Security benefits? </p>

<p>Benefits can be a lifeline, but continuous reliance on them can limit people to a life in poverty. In this webinar to learned more about how you can reframe the conversion and help people you support and their families to consider their options in a new way.  </p>

<h3>Volunteering, Internships, and Unpaid Work Experiences: Legal and Practical Guidelines (February 25, 2016)</h3>

<p>With the expansion of employment in the community and community based non-work, volunteering, internships, and similar activities for people with disabilities are becoming increasingly a part of their daily routines.

<h3>Building Friendships At Work (January 27, 2016)</h3>
<p>It is abundantly clear that friendships are important in everyone's lives. People with friends are happier than those who don't have friends. They have greater self-esteem.
