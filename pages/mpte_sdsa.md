One of the 4 focus areas of MPTE is systematic development of self-determination and self-advocacy skills for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities, with a focus on employment. 

To accomplish this, MPTE is focusing on development of guidelines and materials to ensure that all individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities fully understand their rights and responsibilities regarding employment, how to prepare in school for successful employment as adult, and how to advocate for employment assistance and supports that will result in a career that is reflective of their individual skills, interests, and choices.
