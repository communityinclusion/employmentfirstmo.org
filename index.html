<h2>Planning and Exploration for Employment in the Community</h2>
<p>Employment and integration activities should be driven by individual interests, goals, and needs. In this training, you’ll learn the basics of person-centered planning, and how it serves as the basis for the employment and community integration activities an individual pursues. We’ll also look at how person-centered planning guides and is integrated with exploration and discovery activities that assist individuals in determining their preferences for employment.</p>

<h2>Business Engagement and Job Development</h2>
<p>Developing relationships with businesses is essential for creating employment opportunities. This training will share best practices in employer engagement, with networking as a primary method of connecting with employers. Attendees will learn how to identify and respond to business needs, resulting in strong job matches between the business and job seeker, with effective negotiation strategies at the core.</p>

<h2>Community Life Engagement</h2>
<p>This session will discuss strategies for identifying and supporting individuals in non-work activities in the community. Emphasizing a person-centered approach, we will review how to identify potential activities, and engage with community organizations. We’ll also explain how to use non-work time to support employment efforts for those who are either working or interested in pursuing employment. Strategies for managing schedules of multiple individuals will also be covered.</p>

You’ll also learn about accommodations and assistive technology, as well as strategies for fading.</p>

<h2>Promoting Person-First Language: Why Does it Matter?</h2>

Learn why this is important, and how to incorporate this powerful language style into your communication with individuals and employers, as well as your marketing materials. We’ll discuss how the shift towards person-first language can enhance your workplace culture and promote an environment that focuses on the whole person. We’ll also explore identity-first language and the importance of honoring individual preferences.</p>

<h2>Task Analysis and Breaking New Jobs Down</h2>

We’ll focus on getting to know the individual you’re supporting so that you can break down any new task into steps that person can easily manage. You’ll learn the level and depth that some tasks may need to be broken down into so that individuals can succeed. We’ll also go over ways to choose the best learning method for the individual being supported.</p>

<h2>Volunteering: Do’s and Don’ts</h2>
