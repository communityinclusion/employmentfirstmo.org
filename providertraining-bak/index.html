<p><em>The Department of Developmental Services, in partnership with the Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston presents:</em></p>

<h1>Spring 2014 Training for Massachusetts Employment Support Professionals</h1>

<p>As DDS moves forward with implementation of it's Employment First policy it is important to afford professionals the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver quality integrated employment and day services. This year the ICI is offering two options for training for employment support professionals.  The six session comprehensive series incorporates best practices in career planning, job development, job coaching and support.  The second option provides providers the option to select just those sessions that meet their needs at this time, though it should be noted that Foundations of Community Employment is a prerequisite for the other workshops.</p>

<h2>Comprehensive Employment Supports Training Series</h2>

<p>This six-day, 36-hour training series incorporates state of the art practices in career planning, job development, job coaching and support.  This series includes six full-day sessions that will be held between April and May. It is expected that registrants will attend all training days.</p>

<h2>Employment Support Training Workshops</h2>

<p>This option offers the same content as the Comprehensive Series, but with the flexibility for trainees to take the workshops separately. This training approach is designed for staff who may have more specialized roles, as either job developers or job coaches, or for staff who have participated in some training in the past and need the opportunity to develop skills in a specific area.</p>

<p>While these workshops can be combined, trainees interested in all four workshops are encouraged to register for the Comprehensive Series. </p>

<ul>
<li>Trainees may take Foundations of Community Employment only.</li>
<li>Trainees must take Foundations of Community Employment as a prerequisite if they intend to take any of the following workshops:
