I"Å<p>The Institute for Community Inclusion in partnership with the Department of Developmental Services is offering a Community of Practice (CoP) for providers who are current providers of Community Based Day Support services. </p>

<p>DDS is in the midst of a significant transformation in the provision of day and employment supports.  With the implementation of the Blueprint for Success, CBDS programs are playing a critical role in the development of a pathway to employment and supporting individuals who work part time or are retired. Across the state, there are pockets of true innovation and many examples of promising practices that are helping individuals to go to work and to become more engaged in their communities. </p>

<p>This CoP will bring together a group of providers to engage in a peer-to-peer learning experience that will address topics related to the continued enhancement of community based day supports to offer more individualized, inclusive and meaningful opportunities.  Topics will be selected according to the needs of the participating providers. The CoP will be facilitated by ICI with Genni Sasnett participating as a subject matter expert. Providers will be asked to share promising and innovative practices with their peers and to work together to develop strategies to support transformation. </p>

<p>The CoP will consist of 6 online sessions and one in person meeting.  Providers can identify a team of up to four staff members to participate to help foster learning and build support across the organization for new practices.  Each team is expected to make a commitment to participate in all sessions, both online and in person to provide a consistent and productive learning environment for all. Teams should include at least one member who is in an agency leadership role. </p>
