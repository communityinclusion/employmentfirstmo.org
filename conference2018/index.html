<h3 id="toc_0">Maximizing Job Success Using Assistive Technology</h3>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>

<p><em>Kevin Berner, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>

<p><em>Catherine Bly, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>
<p><em>Randi Sargent, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>

<p>Assistive technology (AT) can be a game changer for an adult with disabilities, helping them to identify, perform, and enjoy employment. AT can improve job performance and reduce the number of one-to-one supports an individual requires to complete job tasks. This workshop explains how providers and families can determine what AT will benefit an individual in their choice of employment, and what job supports can be used. Presenters will review AT that supports work skills, such as scheduling devices, sequencing, reminders/prompting/cueing aids, reading and communication aids, and job coaching tools. </p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Volunteering, Internships, Unpaid Work Experiences: Legal and Practical Guidelines</h3>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong></p>

<p><em>David Hoff, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p>Volunteer work, internships, and unpaid work experiences are often used to explore job and career opportunities. While these can be important tools for job exploration, there are specific wage and hour laws that must be followed when they are used. Join us for this session where we will take a close look at these tools, and discuss the differences between volunteer work, internships, and unpaid work experiences. We&#39;ll go over the specific rules for each, and how they can be used to advance competitive integrated employment. </p>

<p><em>Carole Carlson, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p>Additional presenters TBD</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">When Existing Jobs Don&#39;t Fit: Customizing Employment Opportunities</h3>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong></p>

<p><em>Lara Enein-Donovan, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p>With today’s workforce strategy of consolidating and combining job tasks, it is very difficult to place individuals into preexisting job openings. Finding good job matches requires employment specialists to approach job development in a different way. In this session, we will talk about creating jobs for individuals, including using a good career planning process, identifying and understanding business needs, negotiating with employers, and closing the deal. We will share success stories and have interactive discussion with the audience. </p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Strategies for Supporting Consumers with ASD in Employment</h3>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong><br>
<em>Nataliya Poto, Asperger/Autism Network</em></p>

<p>DDS eligibility has recently been expanded to include individuals with autism who have higher IQ levels. Given the complicated autism profile, individualized approaches can be particularly effective in working with this population. This workshop will use experiences gleaned from a life skills coaching program run by the Asperger/Autism Network to discuss how the autism profile affects employment. Attendees will learn about practices they can apply to set realistic, measurable employment goals while supporting adults on the autism spectrum, and evaluate their progress toward these goals. </p>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>

<p><em>Melanie Jordan, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p><em>Jill Eastman, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>

<p><em>Steve Aalto, WORK, Inc</em></p>

<p><em>Kristen Piccolo, WORK, Inc.</em></p>

<p>&quot;Pathways to Careers&quot; is a zero-exclusion, strength-based employment program design that uses Discovery, visual resumes, paid internships, and systematic instruction to develop employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The career navigator spends 25-30 hours observing individuals in a series of situations that identify their competencies, interests, and conditions that will promote their success. We develop relationships with businesses, identify their unmet needs, and match the individual&#39;s skills and interests to these business tasks. Internship wages are paid for by the program. During the internship, our on-site staff facilitates and develops natural supports. </p>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong></p>

<p><em>Colleen Moynihan, New England Business Associates</em></p>

This session will discuss the basics of developing a business plan, sales strategies, and client development. A success story by a business owner will be shared. </p>
