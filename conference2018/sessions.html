<p>DDS eligibility has recently been expanded to include individuals with autism who have higher IQ levels.

This workshop will use experiences gleaned from a life skills coaching program run by the Asperger/Autism Network to discuss how the autism profile affects employment. Attendees will learn about practices they can apply to set realistic, measurable employment goals while supporting adults on the autism spectrum, and evaluate their progress toward these goals. </p>
