<h3 id="toc_0">Maximizing Job Success Using Assistive Technology</h3>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>

<p><em>Kevin Berner, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>

<p><em>Catherine Bly, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>

<p>Assistive technology (AT) can be a game changer for an adult with disabilities, helping them to identify, perform, and enjoy employment. AT can improve job performance and reduce the number of one-to-one supports an individual requires to complete job tasks. This workshop explains how providers and families can determine what AT will benefit an individual in their choice of employment, and what job supports can be used. Presenters will review AT that supports work skills, such as scheduling devices, sequencing, reminders/prompting/cueing aids, reading and communication aids, and job coaching tools. </p>

<p><em>Additional presenters TBD</em></p>

<p>Students with intellectual disabilities/autism are getting opportunities to include college and work experiences in their transition services. These inclusive dual enrollment opportunities allow students to identify and explore their career interests while they are still eligible for transition services, paving the way to improved preparation for integrated paid employment. The presenters, including students and staff from two Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment partnerships and staff from the Institute for Community Inclusion, will share information and stories about how inclusive dual enrollment can influence career development. </p>

<h3 id="toc_2">When Existing Jobs Don&#39;t Fit: Customizing Employment Opportunities</h3>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong></p>

<p><em>Lara Enein-Donovan, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p>With todayâ€™s workforce strategy of consolidating and combining job tasks, it is very difficult to place individuals into preexisting job openings. Finding good job matches requires employment specialists to approach job development in a different way. In this session, we will talk about creating jobs for individuals, including using a good career planning process, identifying and understanding business needs, negotiating with employers, and closing the deal. We will share success stories and have interactive discussion with the audience. </p>

If you answered yes, then this session is for you. Join us to learn about who to contact, how to prepare for the first meeting, strategies for building a trusting relationship, approaches to introducing the job seeker, and how to address objections or misconceptions. We will have a lively discussion, so be prepared to share. </p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Volunteering, Internships, Unpaid Work Experiences: Legal and Practical Guidelines</h3>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong></p>

<p><em>David Hoff, Institute for Community Inclusion / UMass Boston</em></p>

<p>Volunteer work, internships, and unpaid work experiences are often used to explore job and career opportunities. While these can be important tools for job exploration, there are specific wage and hour laws that must be followed when they are used. Join us for this session where we will take a close look at these tools, and discuss the differences between volunteer work, internships, and unpaid work experiences. We&#39;ll go over the specific rules for each, and how they can be used to advance competitive integrated employment. </p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Public Policy to Practice: Making a Difference in Employment</h3>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong></p>

<p>This session will take a look at a variety of public policy changes on the federal level, and their impact here in Massachusetts. Topics will include the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the Employment First movement, and actions taken by the federal government, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and US Department of Justice. We&#39;ll discuss the relationship between public policy and what happens &quot;on the ground,&quot; future public policy developments, and the need for advocates to make their voices heard to ensure positive efforts on employment continue. </p>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>
