<p>Assisting individuals to obtain jobs during &quot;non-traditional hours,&quot; including weekends and evenings, can allow people to pursue individualized employment goals and expand opportunities for entering the workforce. This presentation will share approaches used to build flexibility into providers&#39; program services. We will go over job descriptions, expectations for job coaches and employment specialists, natural supports, and strategies for collaborating with other key players in the individual’s life to problem-solve and support the person to be successful on the job.</p>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>

<p><em>Kristin Falvey, Bay Cove Human Services</em><br>

<p>It is easy to talk about using community based-day supports to help individuals move into employment, but not so easy to do.  Two current CBDS providers will talk about how they are using a variety of community experiences, volunteer opportunities and other strategies to support the individuals they work with to go to work.  They will share practical tips along with stories we can all learn from.  </p>

Through shared efforts toward the development of work behaviors, career preparation/training, and job placement, youth experience more positive and meaningful employment outcomes.</p>
