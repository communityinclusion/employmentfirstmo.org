<h3 id="toc_0">Maximizing Job Success Using Assistive Technology</h3>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong></p>

<p><em>Kevin Berner, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>

<p><em>Catherine Bly, Easter Seals Massachusetts</em></p>

<p>Assistive technology (AT) can be a game changer for an adult with disabilities, helping them to identify, perform, and enjoy employment. AT can improve job performance and reduce the number of one-to-one supports an individual requires to complete job tasks. This workshop explains how providers and families can determine what AT will benefit an individual in their choice of employment, and what job supports can be used. Presenters will review AT that supports work skills, such as scheduling devices, sequencing, reminders/prompting/cueing aids, reading and communication aids, and job coaching tools. </p>

<p>Additional presenters TBD</p>

<p>Students with intellectual disabilities/autism are getting opportunities to include college and work experiences in their transition services. These inclusive dual enrollment opportunities allow students to identify and explore their career interests while they are still eligible for transition services, paving the way to improved preparation for integrated paid employment. The presenters, including students and staff from two Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment partnerships and staff from the Institute for Community Inclusion, will share information and stories about how inclusive dual enrollment can influence career development.</p>

<p>With todayâ€™s workforce strategy of consolidating and combining job tasks, it is very difficult to place individuals into preexisting job openings. Finding good job matches requires employment specialists to approach job development in a different way. In this session, we will talk about creating jobs for individuals, including using a good career planning process, identifying and understanding business needs, negotiating with employers, and closing the deal. We will share success stories and have interactive discussion with the audience. </p>
